When rendering a partial and specifying a layout through a js request like
`render :partial => 'index', :layout => 'layouts/content_holder'`
custom yield regions such as `yield :h1_text` defined in the layout are rendered as
`yield` instead of `yield :h1_text` causing duplicate content to appear.

My environment is Rails 3.1.1, Ruby 1.9.2, Ubuntu 11.10

To reproduce Yield Render Layout Bug
1. Rake the database
2. Navigate to homepage
3. Notice text is different in both red boxes
4. Click the "Remote Foods Index" link to see "yield" rendered in both boxes.
